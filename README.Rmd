## Overview

The goal of `ClinSight` is to provide a production-ready and easy to use application for medically monitoring patient safety and data integrity during clinical trials. It provides smart and interactive visualizations, so that a better overview can be created of each patient during a trial.

For example, ClinSight contains an interactive timeline, which makes it easy to relate clinical trial procedures such as treatments with adverse events that occur within a patient.

Furthermore, within the application, data patterns over time within patients can be easily visualized with interactive figures, highlighting with different colors what data points are out of the normal limits, and highlighting with the size of each dot whether a data point is newly entered/changed since the last review session.

Data can be saved as being reviewed either by row, or by the entire form that is active:

The application contains a query system, in which queries can be raised for the study site.

Lastly, PDF reports can be created to document a review session:

## ClinSight with custom trial data

The application can be customized for any study using a metadata Excel file (see `vignette('Metadata')`), that controls which data will be shown in where in the application. For more information on how to fully set up ClinSight with custom data, see `vignette('clinsight')`.

## Installation

There are several ways to install `ClinSight`. To run the application with the intended R environment, you can git clone the package repository, then open the project (`clinsight.Rproj`) and restore the project environment with:

```{r , eval=FALSE}
renv::restore()
```

This will install the packages with their intended version. Below the R version and libraries are shown that were used for ClinSight when creating this README file. It is recommended to use the same R version, otherwise errors might occur during installation.

```{r r-version}
renv::lockfile_read()$R
```

Another option for installing clinsight is simply directly installing the latest stable version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r , eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pkg_install("openpharma/clinsight")
```

The development version with the latest features and updates can be installed by pointing to the `dev` branch during installation:

```{r , eval=FALSE}
pak::pkg_install("openpharma/clinsight@dev")
```

After installation, the application can be tested with internal data using the function `test_clinsight()`.

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(clinsight)
# Not run:
test_clinsight()
```
