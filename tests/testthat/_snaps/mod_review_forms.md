# mod_review_forms. Feature 2 | Save review of a form. As a user, I want to be able to save a review of a form in the database. After saving the review, all items of that form that are not yet reviewed should get a tag that the value was reviewed.: Scenario 1 - Save a review. Given test review data with at least an 'Adverse event' form with patient '885',and [user_name] set to 'test_name' and [user_role] to 'Medical Monitor'and [active_patient] set to '885', and [active_form] set to 'Adverse events', and [active_tab] set to 'Common forms', and [form_reviewed] set to FALSE, I expect that I can save a new review properly, with the result saved in the application being the same as the one saved in the database, and no review error occurring

    Code
      lapply(reactiveValuesToList(r$review_data), function(x) {
        dplyr::select(x, -timestamp)
      })
    Output
      $`Adverse events`
