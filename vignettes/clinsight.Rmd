## Running ClinSight for the first time.

### Testing application

The function `clinsight::run_app()` creates databases in the working directory, that will save user actions such as review status of study data. Depending on the settings, a credentials database will be created. When developing ClinSight settings for a specific study, it can be more useful to run ClinSight within a temporary folder, so that the required databases are created every time after closing the application. This makes it easier to prototype the application, and tweak the data/metadata for use with ClinSight. To do so, a wrapper around the `run_app()` function can be used, such as the one below.

```{r }
test_clinsight <- function(
    clinsight_data = clinsightful_data, 
    meta_data = metadata,
    clinsight_config = "test"
){
  temp_folder <- tempfile(tmpdir = tempdir())
  dir.create(temp_folder, recursive = TRUE)
  saveRDS(clinsight_data, file.path(temp_folder, "study_data.rds"))
  saveRDS(meta_data, file.path(temp_folder, "metadata.rds"))
  old_config <- Sys.getenv("GOLEM_CONFIG_ACTIVE")
  Sys.setenv("GOLEM_CONFIG_ACTIVE" = clinsight_config)
  run_app(
    data_folder = temp_folder, 
    credentials_pwd = "TEMP_PASSWORD",
    onStart = \(){onStop(\(){
      unlink(temp_folder, recursive = TRUE);
      Sys.setenv("GOLEM_CONFIG_ACTIVE" = old_config)
    })}
  )
}
```

With this function, we can test ClinSight with custom data and metadata, as will be explained later. Running it without changing default arguments runs ClinSight with internal test data:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Not run:
# If evaluated, this will run ClinSight with internal test data
test_clinsight()
```

### Prepare ClinSight for use with a custom study

In order to use study data with ClinSight, the raw data needs to fulfill few specific requirements and a ClinSight metadata file needs to be customized and created (see `create_clinsight_metadata()` and `get_metadata()`. Then, if requirements are met, the data can be merged with study-specific `metadata` to create custom `ClinSight`-compatible study data. All details about the metadata template can be found in the vignette Metadata `vignette("Metadata")`.

### Raw data structure

Raw study data needs to needs to be in long format in order to use it with ClinSight, with the columns being in character vector format. The following columns are expected to be in the raw data.

|                |                                                                                                                |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Name**       | **Description**                                                                                                |
| site_code      | Identifier for study site.                                                                                     |
| subject_id     | Unique identifier for a subject                                                                                |
| event_id       | Identifies events within a study, such as study visits.                                                        |
| event_date     | The date of the event. Should be convertible from a character vector to a valid date within R.                 |
| event_repeat   | Counter containing a sequence number that increments if an event_id is repeated within the same subject.       |
| form_id        | Identifier for each form. Can be mostly ignored, since new form identifiers are set within ClinSight metadata. |
| form_repeat    | Counter containing a sequence number that increments if a form is repeated within the same subject.            |
| var            | Name of the variable to use in ClinSight. Longer/more appropriate names will be specified in metadata.         |
| item_value     | Value of the variable (`var`) in question.                                                                     |
| edit_date_time | The time at which the value was last edited. Important for efficient reviewing of the data within ClinSight.   |

As an example, we will use raw data included in the package. Note that if the column names differ, they can be adjusted in the metadata if needed, so that they will show up as in the table above after merging.

```{r}
raw_data <- get_raw_csv_data(system.file("raw_data", package = "clinsight"))
head(raw_data)
```

### Merge and prepare data

When metadata is adjusted to the study_specific needs, create an R object from the Excel file:

```{r }
meta_custom <- get_metadata(system.file("metadata.xlsx", package = "clinsight"))
```

Then, merge the metadata with the raw data. This will give some information and will try to throw an informative error if an incompatible change was made:

```{r}
merged_study_data <- merge_meta_with_data(raw_data, meta_custom)
```

Finally, we can start clinsight with our custom data and metadata:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#Not run
test_clinsight(merged_study_data, meta_custom)
```

You will notice that the application shows a warning if some variables defined in the metadata are not available in the actual data, similar to the message below. It is useful to check this output carefully to see if all variable names were entered correctly.

```{r}
# Warning in check_appdata(app_data, meta) :
#   Not all variables defined in metadata are present in the data.
#              var               item_name
# 1 AE_AESER_AEOUT             SAE outcome
# 2     WHO_WHOCAT   WHO.subclassification
# 3       DMOD_DAT    DoseModificationDate
# 4      DMOD_REAS  DoseModificationReason
# 5      DMOD_DOSE DoseModificationNewDose
```

To improve and adjust the application, simply stop the application, adjust the metadata, merge it again with the data, and try again. For example, if we want to change the name of 'Systolic blood pressure' to 'SBP', we can adjust this in the Excel file and use `get_metadata()` again.

We will simulate this behavior here by manually adjusting the metadata file:

```{r}
# !It is better to adjust the Excel metadata file instead of doing this:
meta_custom$items_expanded$item_name[grepl("Systolic blood pressure", meta_custom$items_expanded$item_name)]
adjusted_study_data <- merge_meta_with_data(raw_data, meta_custom)
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
#Not run
test_clinsight(adjusted_study_data, meta_custom) 
```

If changed correctly, the name of the variable will change accordingly in the application:
