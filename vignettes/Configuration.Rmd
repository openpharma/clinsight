ClinSight can be customized using two different configuration files. [General configuration](#general-config) is stored in a configuration `.yml` file, while [study-specific configurations](#study-specific-config) is stored in a metadata Excel file. Both will be discussed in this vignette.

## Study-specific configuration {#study-specific-config}

## Metadata

**Metadata file explanation will follow here.**

## General configuration {#general-config}

The general ClinSight configuration is set using a `golem-config.yml` file. This file mostly contains settings that do not frequently change between studies within an organization, such as organization-specific deployment options. The current configuration file is shown below and will be discussed in detail.

```{r echo = FALSE, results ='markup', comment=""}
cat(readLines(system.file("golem-config.yml", package = "clinsight")), sep = "\n")
```

### Setting configurations

A configuration can be set by changing the GOLEM_CONFIG_ACTIVE environment variable, for example like this:

`Sys.setenv("GOLEM_CONFIG_ACTIVE" = "shinymanager")`

There are multiple configuration settings built in ClinSight, of which the most important ones are: `default`, `test`, `shinymanager`, `shinyproxy`, and `posit_connect`. The first two are meant for testing purposes, while the other settings are more suited for use in production. 

With the standard ('default') settings, internal example data with matching metadata will be used when running `ClinSight` There are the settings used when running `clinsight::run_app()` after a fresh installation. A user database named `user_db.sqlite` will be created in the current working directory if it does not yet exist. This database stores user data such as which data points are reviewed, and which queries are raised.

The default settings are useful for demonstration purposes, but different settings are needed when using `ClinSight` with clinical trial data. Currently, there are three ways to run and/or deploy `ClinSight`, which are mentioned below.

### Testing application

The function `clinsight::run_app()` creates databases in the working directory, that will save user actions such as review status of study data. Depending on the settings, a credentials database will be created. 
When developing ClinSight settings for a specific study, it can be more useful to run ClinSight within a temporary folder, so that the required databases are created every time after closing the application. This makes it easier to prototype the application, and tweak the data/metadata for use with ClinSight. To do so, a wrapper around the `run_app()` function can be used, such as the one below.

```{r }
test_clinsight <- function(
    clinsight_data = clinsightful_data, 
    meta_data = metadata,
    clinsight_config = "test"
){
  temp_folder <- tempfile(tmpdir = tempdir())
  base_folder <- temp_folder
  if(identical(clinsight_config, "shinyproxy")){
    temp_folder <- file.path(temp_folder, "study_data")
  }
  dir.create(temp_folder, recursive = TRUE)
  saveRDS(clinsight_data, file.path(temp_folder, "study_data.rds"))
  saveRDS(meta_data, file.path(temp_folder, "metadata.rds"))
  old_config <- Sys.getenv("GOLEM_CONFIG_ACTIVE")
  Sys.setenv("GOLEM_CONFIG_ACTIVE" = clinsight_config)
  run_app(
    data_folder = base_folder, 
    credentials_pwd = "TEMP_PASSWORD",
    onStart = \(){onStop(\(){
      unlink(temp_folder, recursive = TRUE);
      Sys.setenv("GOLEM_CONFIG_ACTIVE" = old_config)
    })}
  )
}
```

With this function, ClinSight will run with internal test data:

```{r }
# Not run:
if (interactive()){ 
  # This will run ClinSight with internal test data
  test_clinsight()
}
```

It can also be easily used with custom data and metadata:

```{r }
# Not run:
if (interactive()){ 
  # This will run ClinSight with custom data
  test_clinsight(
    clinsight_data = custom_data, 
    meta_data = custom_metadata
  )
}
```

Since everything is run from a temporary folder, clinsight databases be fully renewed when running the function, ensuring that everything is always up to date with the study_data and metadata.

### Shinymanager

One way of deployment is using [shinymanager](https://datastorm-open.github.io/shinymanager/). The `shinymanager` package provides a user authentication and user management layer and its use is preconfigured for `clinsight`. It provides a fast way of deployment, particularly suited for quick local deployment. User and password management information is stored within a local encrypted `credentials.sqlite` database. This provides a brief overview of how shinymanager can be used with ClinSight. For more details, please visit the [shinymanager website](https://datastorm-open.github.io/shinymanager/).

To use `shinymanager` with ClinSight, first make sure that the `shinymanager` package is installed, then set the configuration accordingly with `Sys.setenv("GOLEM_CONFIG_ACTIVE" = "shinymanager")`. This configuration expects the files `study_data.rds` and `metadata.rds` to be present in the current working directory. Finally, a credentials password needs to be provided in the `run_app()` command; this is used to encrypt/decrypt the database.

```{r shinymanager-example}
# Not run:
# Warning: this will create multiple files in the current working directory.
if (interactive()){ 
  saveRDS(clinsightful_data, "study_data.rds")
  saveRDS(metadata, "metadata.rds")
  Sys.setenv("GOLEM_CONFIG_ACTIVE" = "shinymanager")
  run_app(credentials_pwd = "TEMP_PASSWORD")
}
```

This code will first save the internal package data in the working directory, and then create a `user_db.sqlite` file and a `credentials.sqlite` file in the same directory. Alternatively, you can test it with by using the `test_clinsight` function just created, so that all needed files are only created temporarily:

```{r}
test_clinsight(clinsight_config = "shinymanager")
```

Note that the `credentials.sqlite` database is protected for unauthorized access with the password provided in the argument `credentials_pwd` (currently set to "TEMP_PASSWORD"). If the code above is run, a login page will be shown.

![](images/shinymanager_login.png){width="349"}

For the first login, the `credentials.sqlite` database is newly created. In this case, the login name will be 'admin' and the password `1234`. After first login, a password change and a login with the new password is required before the ClinSight app can be accessed.

![](images/shinymanager_change_pw.png){width="336"}

After successful login, new users can be added by going to the Administrator panel using the widget in the bottom right of the screen:

![](images/shinymanager_admin_mode.png)

When creating a new user, make sure that the User field does not contain spaces and that the expiration date and the sites that the user needs to access are entered/selected correctly.

More details can be found in the documentation of the [shinymanager](https://datastorm-open.github.io/shinymanager/) package.

### Shinyproxy

Another way of deployment can be with the use of [shinyproxy](https://shinyproxy.io/). `ShinyProxy` is fully open source software and provides multiple options for deploying shiny applications, with built-in support for the latest authentication and authorization technologies such as [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/). It serves shiny (or other data science) applications in Docker containers. This provides multiple advantages, among which the possibility to run applications fully isolated, and to deploy multiple versions of an application without any problems. 

This guide provides some brief hints to get started with a `ShinyProxy` deployment. 

First download and install `ShinyProxy` according to the instructions on the [ShinyProxy website](https://shinyproxy.io/). 
Second step is to store ClinSight in a Docker image. A good place to start are the images from the [Rocker Project](https://rocker-project.org/), which can be fairly quick to setup. Alternatively, smaller Docker images with less dependencies can be created with [Alpine Linux images](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine). This will probably take longer to set up, since Rstudio Package Manager provides no binaries for Alpine Linux at the time of writing, meaning that all R packages need to be installed from source.

```{yaml}
proxy:
  title: "ClinSight Portal"
  port: 8080
  authentication: openid
  container-wait-time: 60000
  openid:
    auth-url: ...
    jwks-url: ...
    token-url: ...
    client-id: ...
    client-secret: ...
    username-attribute: email
    roles-claim: roles
  docker:
    internal-networking: true
  admin-groups: admin
  specs:
  - id: app_1
    display-name: "ClinSight - test"
    container-image: clinsight_image:latest
    container-volumes: ["${LOCAL_DATA_FOLDER}/study_data:/home/clinsight_user/study_data"]
    container-network: internal_network
    http-headers:
      X_SP_USERNAME: "#{T(java.util.Base64).getEncoder().encodeToString(oidcUser.getFullName().getBytes())}"
```

### Posit Connect

Lastly, ClinSight provides a configuration to deploy applications with Posit Connect. 

To use this configuration, use 

### Customizing configuration

If the profiles above are insufficient, you can also provide your own configuration file with fully customized settings with the steps described below.

To do so, first create a configuration template. The function [create_clinsight_config()] can be used to create a copy of the current `clinsight` configuration file in the current working directory. To use this configuration file with `clinsight`, the environment variable named "CONFIG_PATH" needs to be set by using a command similar to the following: `Sys.setenv("CONFIG_PATH" = "PATH_TO_CONFIG/clinsight_config.yml")`, where `PATH_TO_CONFIG` is the path to the folder in which the configuration file is located.
